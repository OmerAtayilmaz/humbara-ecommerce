00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.180 line:25
You can't connect the dots looking forward.

2
00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:06.480  line:25
You can only connect them looking backwards.

3
00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:10.620  line:25
So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

4
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.740  line:25
You have to trust in something your gut, destiny, life, karma, whatever ever.

5
00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:17.440  line:25
Because believing that the dots will

6
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:22.220  line:25
connect down the road will give you the confidence to follow your heart even

7
00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:28.280  line:25
when it leads you off the wellworn path and that will make all the difference.

8
00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.620  line:25
Your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life.

9
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.180  line:25
Don't be trapped by dogma which is living

10
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.660  line:25
with the results of other people's thinking.

11
00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.540  line:25
Don't let the noise of other opinions drown out your own inner voice.

12
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.820  line:25
You've got to find what you love

13
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:50.660  line:25
and that is as true for work as it is for your lovers.

14
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:54.480  line:25
Your work is going to fill a large part of your life and the only way to be truly

15
00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:57.580  line:25
satisfied is to do what you believe is great work.

16
00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.980  line:25
And the only way to do great work is to love what you do.

17
00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:07.620  line:25
If you haven't found it yet, keep looking and don't settle.

18
00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.660  line:25
Have the courage to follow your heart and intuition.

19
00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:16.200  line:25
They somehow already know what you truly want to become.

20
00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.840  line:25
But you're going to have some ups and you're going to have some downs.

21
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.100  line:25
Most people give up on themselves easily.

22
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.980 line:25
You know, the human spirit is powerful.

23
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.290  line:25
There's nothing as powerful.

24
00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:30.850  line:25
It's hard to kill the human spirit.

25
00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:33.200  line:25
Anybody can feel good when they have their

26
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:36.340  line:25
health, their bills are paid, they have happy relationships.

27
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.320  line:25
Anybody can be positive then anybody can have a larger vision,

28
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.520  line:25
then anybody can have faith under those kinds of circumstances.

29
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.340  line:25
The real challenge of growth mentally,

30
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:56.880  line:25
emotionally and spiritually comes when you get knocked down.

31
00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.020  line:25
It takes courage to act part of being hungry.

32
00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:09.720  line:25
When you've been defeated it takes courage to start over again.

33
00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.780  line:25
Fear kills dreams, fear kills hope.

34
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:27.450  line:25
Fear put people in the hospital.

35
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.610  line:25
Fear can aid you, can hold you back from doing something

36
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:38.040  line:25
that you know within yourself that you are capable of doing but it will paralyse you.

37
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.740  line:25
At the end of your feelings is nothing

38
00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:51.260  line:25
but at the end of every principle is a promise behind your love feelings.

39
00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.660  line:25
It might not be absolutely nothing

40 
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.610  line:25
at the end of your love feelings but behind every principle is a promise

41
00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.860  line:25
and some of you in your life the reason why you're not at your goal right now

42
00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.380  line:25
because you're just all about your feelings.

43
00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.640  line:25
You're all on your feelings.

44
00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.120  line:25
You don't feel like waking up so who does?

45
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.140  line:25
Every day you say no to your dreams you

46
00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.220  line:25
might be pushing your dreams back a whole six months, a whole year.

47
00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:18.320  line:25
That one single day that one day you

48
00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:22.720  line:25
didn't get up could have pushed your stuff back I don't know how long.

49
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.180  line:25
Don't allow your emotions to control you.

50
00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.740  line:25
We are emotional but you want to begin to discipline your emotions.

51
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.660  line:25
If you don't discipline and contain your emotions.

52
00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.800  line:25
They will use you.

53
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.020  line:25
You want it and you're going to go all out to have it.

54
00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.980  line:25
It's not going to be easy when you want to change, it's not easy.

55
00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.540  line:25
If it were in fact easy, everybody would do it.

56
00:03:53.570 --> 00:03:57.760  line:25
But if you're serious, you'll go all out.

57
00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:03.180  line:25
I'm in control here.

58
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.860  line:25
I'm not going to let this get me down.

59
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:08.420  line:25
I'm not going to let this destroy me.

60
00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:12.820  line:25
I'm coming back and I'll be stronger and better because of it.

61
00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:16.140  line:25
You have got to make a declaration.

62
00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:18.220  line:25
This is what you stand for.

63
00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.860  line:25
You're standing up for your dreams.

64
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:21.500  line:25
You're standing up for peace of mind.

65 
00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.020  line:25
You're standing up for help.

66 
00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.420  line:25
Take full responsibility for your life.

67
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.780  line:25
Accept where you are

68
00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.960  line:25
and the responsibility that you're going to take yourself where you want to go.

69
00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:39.500  line:25
You can decide that I'm going to live each day as if it were my last.

70
00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:46.880  line:25
Live your life with passion, with some drive.

71
00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.860  line:25
Decide that you're going to push yourself.

72
00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:53.140  line:25
The last chapter to your life has not been written yet.

73
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:55.980  line:25
And it doesn't matter about what happened yesterday.

74
00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:57.840  line:25
It doesn't matter about what happens to you.

75
00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:02.240  line:25
What matters is what are you going to do about it.

76
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.900  line:25
This year I will make this goal become a reality.

77
00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.340  line:25
I won't talk about it anymore.

78
00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:12.860  line:25
I can. I can.

79
00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:14.840  line:25
I can.

80
00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:39.340  line:25
The first of her, I think, is your important for everybody.

81
00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:41.940  line:25
Don't give up. Don't give in.

82
00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.480  line:25
There's always an answer to everything.
